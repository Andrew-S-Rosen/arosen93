### Hi!! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Miller Research Fellow in Materials Science and Engineering at UC Berkeley. I will soon be leading the Rosen Research Group (a.k.a. the "Quantum Accelerators") at ~redacted~.
  
Check our group GitHub page: [@Quantum-Accelerators](https://github.com/Quantum-Accelerators/).
